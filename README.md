## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Background radial gradient

### What I learned

I tried to use gradient background. Because in the Figma file, the backgroun change between desktop and mobile and I tried to make it. I'm pretty happy because gradient was always a little bit scary for me to use.

### Continued development

I will try to have a better html and css structure for the next project. I also want to add some comment to be clear wy I'm doing this way.

### Useful resources

- [Radial Gradiant](https://www.quirksmode.org/css/images/position.html) - Help me a lot.
